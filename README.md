## RandomNumberGeneration_Python
This file is basically a collection of a couple of mini group projects that we did, which are actually academic in nature.
These contain the implementation of the following psuedo random number generation schemes:
## 1. RANDOM MODULE IN PYTHON:
This basically has the psuedo random generation function called Linear Congruential Generator algorithm implemented in it and we just 
try to use this at about 3 levels of randomness.
## 2. FLAGGED FIBONACCI GENERATION:
This basically mimics the logic of Fibonacci series and instead of an 'addition' operation, we have tried to implement the BITWISE Exclusive OR in this. Also, the operands on which the XOR operation has to be done are to be selected using a more complex procedure. We tried to simplify the complexity of the code using the simplicity of building upon the favourite number provided by the user.

Finally, to wrap this up, we try to make the user guess what the number is and upon successive failures, provide a negative reinforcement.
The hint for the number identification is generated at the last chance of the guessing, which could have a lot of improvement.
## LINUX FUNCTIONALITY IMPLEMENTATION
I have tried to implement some commands that can be interpreted on the linux kernel, purely using system calls. These commands include "mv", "cat" and some other miscellaneous instructions.
## SORTING TECHNIQUES AND THEIR COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
Here, I have compared and contrasted some sorting algorithms which have the same asymptotic running time, but perform differently on different input values. These work completely on randomly generated inputs and emit out time required for sorting 5 data sets, namely of 100k to 500k numbers, with step size of 100k numbers.
The sorting algorithms presented are : 
 1. Recursive and Iterative Quicksorts
 2. Recursive and Iterative Mergesorts
 3. Bubble, Insertion and Selection Sorts, (each one of these iterative)
 
## DATA STRUCTURES 
### 1. HEAPS AND HEAPSORT
Code for maxHeapify (O(nlgn)), buildMaxHeap(O(n)) and heapSort(O(nlgn)) and comparative analysis for data sets of different 
sizes.
### 2. GRAPHS
Code for implementation of graphs using adjascency matrix and also for BFS, DFS (using STL support in CPP) and topological 
sort. 
### 3. SET DS USING HASH TABLE
Code for implementing set data structure using hash tables, hased using linear chaining method. This contains all the operations possible on a set DS, like union, intersection, symmetric difference, etc.
### 4. SET DS USING LINKED LIST
Code for implementing set Data Structure using linked lists, implementing the same functions as used above. 
### 5. BINARY SEARCH TREES 
Assignment for binary search trees(academic), contains all the basic preliminaries and all other sorts of stuff.
## MATRIX MULTIPLICATION ALGORITHM
This section of the code contains the methods for naive matrix multiplication, multiplication of matrices using divide and conquer and matrix multiplcation by Strassen's algorithm.
