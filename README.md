# RandomNumberGeneration_Python
This repository is basically a collection of a couple of mini group projects that we did, which are actually academic in nature.
These contain the implementation of the following psuedo random number generation schemes:
# 1. RANDOM MODULE IN PYTHON:
This basically has the psuedo random generation function called Linear Congruential Generator algorithm implemented in it and we just 
try to use this at about 3 levels of randomness.
# 2. FLAGGED FIBONACCI GENERATION:
This basically mimics the logic of Fibonacci series and instead of an 'addition' operation, we have tried to implement the BITWISE Exclusive OR in this. Also, the operands on which the XOR operation has to be done are to be selected using a more complex procedure. We tried to simplify the complexity of the code using the simplicity of building upon the favourite number provided by the user.

Finally, to wrap this up, we try to make the user guess what the number is and upon successive failures, provide a negative reinforcement.
The hint for the number identification is generated at the last chance of the guessing, which could have a lot of improvement.
